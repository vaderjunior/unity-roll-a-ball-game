# Roll-a-Ball (Unity)

Small Unity project for the **Interaction in AR & VR** course.  
Just a basic roll-a-ball prototype; I’m using it to learn Unity and the Input System.

## How to run
- Open the project in Unity Hub (Unity 2022 LTS or similar).
- Open Assets/Scenes/minigame.unity (or SampleScene.unity) and press Play.
